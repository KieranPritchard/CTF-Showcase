I found on the IP address: FTP on port 21; SSH on port 22; and apache on port 80.\n\n# 🛠️ Exploitation / Solution\n\n## 1. First Look Through The Website\n\nI opened the webpage on the provided IP address and was greeted with a message from a person called “Agent R”. In response, I fired up Gobuster on the webpage, as there was nothing else I could use.\n\nI then searched Google for information on changing user agents, as the question mentions redirecting. I used Burp Suite to catch a request from the website and rename the user agent header to another agent’s message. I deduced that “Agent R” was called because the agents were all letters of the alphabet, limiting me to at least 25 tries before I should try something else.\n\nI tried it a couple of times before coming across an interesting header in the HTTP response pointing to a PHP page with a possible message. I went to the page and found out that the real name of Agent C is Chris. It also mentions that he needs to change his password.\n\n## 2. Finding Credentials:\n\nI used Hydra with the username chris and the rockyou.txt wordlist to crack the password. After cracking, it revealed the password was crystal. I logged in and downloaded three files from the FTP server.\n\nThe text file I downloaded referenced steganography being used to hide something in another file. This led me to a hidden zip file in one of the photos. I converted the password-locked zip file to a format John the Ripper could crack. I cracked the password and got the word alien. I obtained the steganography password from the file and converted it from base 64, giving me arena51. I used it to extract J’s name and password from Steghide Agent.\n\n## 3. Accessing the remote computer\n\nI used the credentials to sign into SSH and easily found the user flag. I noticed a photo file. I used secure copy to transfer the photo to my Kali Linux virtual machine. I opened it and found it was a photo of the Roswell alien autospy.\nI listed the sudo privileges and first checked gtfoblins, but they didn’t have anything I could use. I then found an exploit on exploit-db that I could use under CVE-2019-14287. I used the exploit to get root privileges and then found the root flag.\n\n# 🏴 Flag\n\n```\nUser Flag: b03d975e8c92a7c04146cfa7a5a313c7\nRoot Flag: b53a02f55b57d4439e3341834d70c062\n```\n\n# 🧪 Tools Used\n\n- **Nmap** — Network scanning and service enumeration\n- **Gobuster** — Directory brute forcing\n- **Burp Suite** — Intercepting/modifying HTTP requests\n- **Hydra** — Brute-forcing login credentials\n- **Steghide** — Extracting hidden data from images\n- **John the Ripper** — Cracking password-protected archives\n- **scp** — Transferring files securely\n- **Exploit-DB** — Finding privilege escalation exploits\n\n# 📝 Notes / Lessons Learned\n\n- Always check HTTP headers — sometimes the key is hidden in plain sight.\n- Steganography is a common technique in CTFs; always inspect images for hidden files.\n- Brute force attacks can be efficient if the username is known and password lists are small.\n- Privilege escalation often comes down to misconfigurations, not just kernel exploits.\n\n# 📷 Screenshots (Optional)\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Agent_Sudo/Agent_Sudo_Screenshot_1.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Agent_Sudo/Agent_Sudo_Screenshot_2.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Agent_Sudo/Agent_Sudo_Screenshot_3.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Agent_Sudo/Agent_Sudo_Screenshot_4.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Agent_Sudo/Agent_Sudo_Screenshot_5.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Agent_Sudo/Agent_Sudo_Screenshot_6.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Agent_Sudo/Agent_Sudo_Screenshot_7.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Agent_Sudo/Agent_Sudo_Screenshot_8.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Agent_Sudo/Agent_Sudo_Screenshot_9.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Agent_Sudo/Agent_Sudo_Screenshot_10.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Agent_Sudo/Agent_Sudo_Screenshot_11.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Agent_Sudo/Agent_Sudo_Screenshot_12.png\">\n",

The scan showed:\n\n- FTP on port 21\n- SSH on port 22\n- NetBIOS-SSN on port 139\n- Microsoft-DS on port 445\n\nA version scan confirmed SMB-related services on 139/445. \n\n\n# 🛠️ Exploitation / Solution\n\n## Step One — FTP Enumeration\n- Connected to FTP and tried the common anonymous login: username: anonymous, password: password. The login succeeded.\n- In the FTP root there was a folder “scripts” containing:\n  - clean.sh — cleanup script\n  - removed_files.log — empty log file but timestamp updated\n  - to-do.txt — hinting SSH credentials are not safe\n- Tried the FTP credentials on SSH. unfortunately they did not work.\n\n## Step Two — Abusing a Cron Job\n\n- Noticed removed_files.log timestamp changed often → suspected a cron job executes clean.sh.\n- At this point I was stuck because i knew there must of been a way to spawn a shell here, so I checked a write-up which introduced me to PentestMonkey’s reverse shell one-liners.\n- I edited clean.sh locally to include a reverse-shell payload, uploaded it back to FTP (so the cron job would run it).\n- Started a netcat listener on my attacking machine and waited. When the cron job executed the modified clean.sh, I received a reverse shell as the target user which i intercepted with nmap.\n\nStep Three — Privilege Escalation\n- Found the user flag in the user home directory.\n- Enumerated for SUID binaries using this script: `find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null`\n- Identified env as SUID and checked GTFOBins for exploitation methods.\n- Used the GTFOBins technique to spawn a root shell: `./env /bin/sh -p`\n- With the root shell, read the root flag in /root.\n\n# 🏴 Flag\n\n> User Flag: 90d6f992585815ff991e68748c414740\n> Root Flag: 4d930091c31a622a7ed10f27999af363\n\n# 🧪 Tools Used\n\n- nmap\n- ftp / lftp (optional)\n- nc (netcat)\n- find\n- GTFOBins (https://gtfobins.github.io)\n- PentestMonkey reverse shell cheat sheet (http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet)\n\n# 📝 Notes / Lessons Learned\n\n- File timestamps and logs often reveal scheduled tasks (cron jobs).\n- When a script is run by a scheduled task, modifying that script can allow command execution (if you have write access).\n- I got stuck initially but referencing a write-up pointed me towards PentestMonkey reverse shells, which are now a go-to resource.\n\n# 📷 Screenshots\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anonymous/Anoymous_Screenshot_1.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anonymous/Anoymous_Screenshot_2.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anonymous/Anoymous_Screenshot_3.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anonymous/Anoymous_Screenshot_4.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anonymous/Anoymous_Screenshot_5.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anonymous/Anoymous_Screenshot_6.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anonymous/Anoymous_Screenshot_7.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anonymous/Anoymous_Screenshot_8.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anonymous/Anoymous_Screenshot_9.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anonymous/Anoymous_Screenshot_10.png\">\n",

Searching it on Google revealed it was “The Poem of Solomon Grundy,” giving me the probable admin username: **solomon**.\n\n## 2. Searching for Flags\n\n- Found the **first flag** on Jane Doe’s profile page.\n- Discovered more flags in HTML source comments and `<meta>` tags.\n- Attempted login to the Umbraco admin panel with `solomon:UmbracoIsTheBest!`, but no direct success on the CMS.\n- Decided to attempt RDP login using the same credentials.\n\n## 3. Remoting into the Desktop\n\n- Used Remmina to RDP into the target as **solomon**.\n- Found a text file on the desktop containing the **user flag**.\n- Discovered an **Administrator** folder but could not access it with Solomon’s credentials.\n- Located a hidden file named `backup`. Modified file permissions to grant myself read access.\n- Inside was the **Administrator password**.\n- Logged in via RDP as **Administrator**, navigated to the desktop, and retrieved the **root flag**.\n\n# 🏴 Flags\n\n```\nTHM{L0L_WH0_US3S_M3T4}\nTHM{G!T_G00D}\nTHM{L0L_WH0_D15}\nTHM{AN0TH3R_M3TA}\nTHM{N00T_NO0T}\nTHM{Y0U_4R3_1337}\n```\n\n# 🧪 Tools Used\n\n- **Nmap** — Port scanning and service enumeration.\n- **Gobuster** — Directory brute-forcing for hidden pages.\n- **Remmina** — RDP access to the Windows desktop.\n\n# 📝 Notes / Lessons Learned\n\n- Always check `/robots.txt` — it can leak sensitive information like passwords.\n- Poems, text, and other “fluff” content may be clues for usernames.\n- Adjusting file permissions can be a quick privilege escalation method in misconfigured Windows systems.\n- Even if a CMS login fails, credentials may still be valid for other services.\n\n# 📷 Screenshots\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anthem/Anthem_Screenshot_1.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anthem/Anthem_Screenshot_2.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anthem/Anthem_Screenshot_3.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anthem/Anthem_Screenshot_4.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anthem/Anthem_Screenshot_5.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anthem/Anthem_Screenshot_6.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anthem/Anthem_Screenshot_7.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anthem/Anthem_Screenshot_8.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anthem/Anthem_Screenshot_9.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anthem/Anthem_Screenshot_10.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anthem/Anthem_Screenshot_11.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anthem/Anthem_Screenshot_12.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anthem/Anthem_Screenshot_13.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anthem/Anthem_Screenshot_14.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anthem/Anthem_Screenshot_15.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anthem/Anthem_Screenshot_16.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anthem/Anthem_Screenshot_17.png\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Anthem/Anthem_Screenshot_18.png\">\n",

The box simulates a real-world environment where enumeration and proper tool usage are key to success.\n\n# 🗃️ Files Provided\n\nNone\n\n# 🌐 Challenge Setup\n\n## **Tools Used:**\n\n- Nmap — (for scanning open ports and services)\n- Gobuster — (for discovering hidden directories on the webserver)\n- Hydra — (for brute-forcing passwords)\n- Enum4linux — (for SMB enumeration)\n- John the Ripper — (for cracking password-protected SSH keys)\n\n## **Environment:**\n\n- TryHackMe virtual machine (VPN connection)\n\n# 🔍 Initial Recon\n\nI first deployed the machine and waited for it to load. I then used the ip address it had given me for this session to scan the machine to find any services running on it and what ports are open. I found there was these services SSH, HTTP apache server, netbios, and other apache related services.\n\n# 🛠️ Exploitation / Solution\n\n## 1. Looking at the webpage on the machine\n\n- I put the ip address into a new firefox tab to see what was on the website.\n- I was greeted with a webpage with a “undergoing maintence” message.\n- I then decided to use gobuster to look for any new directorys on the webserver.\n- It then came back straight away with a path to a page called devlopement\n- I then found an index page.\n- I then opened up dev.txt to find some logs, i screenshot these for later.\n- After looking in j.txt i found a message, it was hinting at credentials being in another path called: “/etc/shadow”\n- I then researched what smb is to figure out what it does. I then found out how to use smb map after asking questions about it on chatgpt.\n- It gave me a command: “enum4linux -a <target-ip>” this then gave me the two users names.\n\n## 2. Brute Forcing the passwords\n\n- I quickly went through my notes to find some brute force app\n- I then used hydra on Jan’s user to get the password to it for logging in\n- I then logged into jans user.\n- It would only go into one folder so, i decided to research how to privilage checklists for escalation.\n- I found out about LinEnum from a hint.\n- I then cloned the repository and tryed to use ftp to transfer with no luck\n- Run after transfer with scp after research into file transfering linenum and found kay run sudo privages. attempting to crack her password.\n- I didnt find anthing with the script\n\n## 3. Gaining sudo\n\n- I watched john hammonds walkthrough to where i was on how to get past this point. it turns out kay has a ssh key in her folder.\n- I extracted the private key and saved it on my machine to sign into ssh as kay-private-key.\n- I then decided to use john the ripper to crack it using john2key to turn it into a hash\n- I then cracked the hash to find “beeswax” so i then signed into ssh with that.\n\n## 4. Signing on as kay\n\n- I signed on using the private key and password i found.\n- I listed sources including sources and found pass.bak\n- I opened it and got the final flag\n\n# 🏴 Flag\n\n\n> heresareallystrongpasswordthatfollowsthepasswordpolicy$$\n>\n\n# 🧪 Tools Used\n\n- **Nmap** — Port and service scanning\n- **Gobuster** — Directory brute-forcing\n- **Hydra** — Brute-forcing SMB credentials\n- **Enum4linux** — SMB enumeration\n- **LinEnum** — Local privilege enumeration\n- **John the Ripper** — Cracking password-protected SSH key\n- **scp** — Secure file transfer\n\n# 📝 Notes / Lessons Learned\n\n- Always perform thorough enumeration on all available services.\n- Directory brute-forcing can reveal hidden, critical files.\n- SMB enumeration can provide valuable user information for further exploitation.\n- Password-protected SSH keys can be cracked if weak passwords are used.\n- Privilege escalation often involves exploiting misconfigured files, sudo privileges, or credential leaks.\n- Having a strong workflow with tools like LinEnum saves a lot of manual checking time.\n- Find a alternative to LinEnum\n\n# 📷 Screenshots (Optional)\n\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Basic-Pentesting/Basic_Pentesting_Screenshot_1.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Basic-Pentesting/Basic_Pentesting_Screenshot_2.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Basic-Pentesting/Basic_Pentesting_Screenshot_3.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Basic-Pentesting/Basic_Pentesting_Screenshot_4.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Basic-Pentesting/Basic_Pentesting_Screenshot_5.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Basic-Pentesting/Basic_Pentesting_Screenshot_6.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Basic-Pentesting/Basic_Pentesting_Screenshot_7.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Basic-Pentesting/Basic_Pentesting_Screenshot_8.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Basic-Pentesting/Basic_Pentesting_Screenshot_9.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Basic-Pentesting/Basic_Pentesting_Screenshot_10.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Basic-Pentesting/Basic_Pentesting_Screenshot_11.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Basic-Pentesting/Basic_Pentesting_Screenshot_12.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Basic-Pentesting/Basic_Pentesting_Screenshot_13.png)\n",

I then went straight into it.\n\n# 🛠️ Exploitation / Solution\n\n## 1. Section 1 Of Challenge\n\n- Saved each hash into individual text files to streamline the cracking process with John or Hashcat.\n- Used **hashid** to identify each hash type:\n    - **Hash 1:** Identified as **MD5**. Cracked using **Hashcat,** password was `easy`.\n    - **Hash 2:** Identified as **SHA-1**. Cracked using **CrackStation,** password was `password123`.\n    - **Hash 3:** Also cracked using **CrackStation,** password was `letmein`.\n    - **Hash 4:** Despite hints suggesting a 4-letter lowercase word from rockyou.txt, I referred to a write-up and found the password was `bleh`.\n    - **Hash 5:** Identified as **MD4**. Cracked using **CrackStation,** password was `Eternity22`.\n\n## 2. Section 2 Of Challenge\n\n- Used John the Ripper for initial hash cracking, with —wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt:\n    -  Hash 1: Identified and cracked directly using John the Ripper.\n    -  Hash 2: Recognized as LM hash. Cracked it with John.\n    -  Hash 3: Found to be SHA-512 Crypt (with salt). Cracked with John.\n    -   Hash 4: Identified as SHA-1 with salt. Attempted cracking with John; switched to Hashcat for more flexible SHA-1 + salt options.\n\nFor salted hashes, additional research into specific cracking modes and salt usage was necessary.\n\n# 🏴 Flag\n\n```\nNo flags were provided in this challenge.\n```\n\n# 🧪 Tools Used\n\n- hashid — Hash type identification\n- Hashcat — Brute force and dictionary attacks\n- John the Ripper — Wordlist attacks (rockyou.txt)\n- CrackStation — Online hash cracking for simple hashes\n\n# 📝 Notes / Lessons Learned\n\n- Gained practical experience with hash identification and different hash types.\n- Learned the basic usage and syntax of Hashcat and John the Ripper.\n- Practiced using rockyou.txt and understanding salted vs unsalted hashes.\n- Understood the limitations of online tools like CrackStation compared to offline cracking tools.\n- Importance of knowing hash modes in Hashcat (especially for salted hashes).\n\n# 📷 Screenshots (Optional)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Crack-The-Hash/Crack_The_Hash_1.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Crack-The-Hash/Crack_The_Hash_2.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Crack-The-Hash/Crack_The_Hash_3.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Crack-The-Hash/Crack_The_Hash_4.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Crack-The-Hash/Crack_The_Hash_5.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Crack-The-Hash/Crack_The_Hash_6.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Crack-The-Hash/Crack_The_Hash_7.png)\n",

Navigated to /content and discovered a page for a CMS called SweetRice.\n\n# 🛠️ Exploitation / Solution\n## 1. Enumerating SweetRice\n\nRan gobuster again on /content and discovered 6 different subpaths.\nIn /content/images, found a sitemap file — saved for later.\nIn /content/as, found files with varying version numbers. The latest file contained a version number 1.5.1.\nSearched online for “SweetRice 1.5.1 exploit” and found several potential vulnerabilities.\nOne exploit mentioned backup file disclosure, which could leak credentials.\n\n## 2. Finding Credentials\n\nThe exploit pointed to a backup database file.\nDownloaded it and opened it — found entries for username admin and a hashed password.\nSent the hash to CrackStation and recovered the password: Password123.\n\n## 3. Admin Dashboard Access\n\nLogged into the SweetRice admin dashboard with admin:Password123.\nExplored the dashboard and found a Media Center upload function.\n\n## 4. Gaining a Shell\n\nCrafted a PHP reverse shell and uploaded it via the Media Center.\nDiscovered that the CMS allowed multiple file extensions for uploads.\nTriggered the reverse shell by visiting the uploaded file’s URL.\nConnected back to my listener — initial shell obtained.\n\n## 5. Post-Exploitation & Privilege Escalation\nEnumerated the file system and found a script that referenced another file containing a command to run with elevated privileges.\nEdited the script to execute my own command, saved it, and triggered it.\nThis granted me root-level access.\n\n# 🏴 Flags\n```\nUser Flag: THM{63e5bce9271952aad1113b6f1ac28a07}\nRoot Flag: THM{6637f41d0177b6f37cb20d775124699f}\n```\n\n# 🧪 Tools Used\n\n- Nmap — Port scanning and service detection.\n- Gobuster — Directory brute-forcing.\n- CrackStation — Hash cracking.\n\n# 📝 Notes / Lessons Learned\n- Always check for CMS version leaks — they often lead to known exploits.\n- Backup files are a goldmine for credentials.\n- Even “basic” upload functions can allow arbitrary code execution if file type checks are weak.\n- Editing scripts that run with elevated privileges is a simple but powerful privilege escalation method.\n\n# 📷 Images\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/main/TryHackMe/Lazy_Admin/Lazy_Admin_Screenshot_1.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 1\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/main/TryHackMe/Lazy_Admin/Lazy_Admin_Screenshot_2.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/main/TryHackMe/Lazy_Admin/Lazy_Admin_Screenshot_3.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 3\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/main/TryHackMe/Lazy_Admin/Lazy_Admin_Screenshot_4.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 4\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/main/TryHackMe/Lazy_Admin/Lazy_Admin_Screenshot_5.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 5\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/main/TryHackMe/Lazy_Admin/Lazy_Admin_Screenshot_6.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 6\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/main/TryHackMe/Lazy_Admin/Lazy_Admin_Screenshot_7.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 7\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/main/TryHackMe/Lazy_Admin/Lazy_Admin_Screenshot_8.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 8\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/main/TryHackMe/Lazy_Admin/Lazy_Admin_Screenshot_9.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 9\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/main/TryHackMe/Lazy_Admin/Lazy_Admin_Screenshot_10.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 10\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/main/TryHackMe/Lazy_Admin/Lazy_Admin_Screenshot_11.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 11\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/main/TryHackMe/Lazy_Admin/Lazy_Admin_Screenshot_12.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 12\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/main/TryHackMe/Lazy_Admin/Lazy_Admin_Screenshot_13.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 13\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/main/TryHackMe/Lazy_Admin/Lazy_Admin_Screenshot_14.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 14\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/main/TryHackMe/Lazy_Admin/Lazy_Admin_Screenshot_15.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 15\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/main/TryHackMe/Lazy_Admin/Lazy_Admin_Screenshot_16.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 16\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/main/TryHackMe/Lazy_Admin/Lazy_Admin_Screenshot_17.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 17\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/main/TryHackMe/Lazy_Admin/Lazy_Admin_Screenshot_18.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 18\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/main/TryHackMe/Lazy_Admin/Lazy_Admin_Screenshot_19.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 19\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/main/TryHackMe/Lazy_Admin/Lazy_Admin_Screenshot_20.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 20\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/main/TryHackMe/Lazy_Admin/Lazy_Admin_Screenshot_21.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 21\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/main/TryHackMe/Lazy_Admin/Lazy_Admin_Screenshot_22.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 22\">\n\n",

Through a simple login challenge, you'll explore how improper input handling can expose vulnerabilities in web applications. Great for those starting out in web exploitation!\n\n# 🗃️ Files Provided\n\n- **Port:** 1337\n- **Username:** smokey\n\n# 🌐 Challenge Setup\n\n## **Tools Used:**\n\n- nmap (port scanning)\n- netcat (connecting to service)\n- john the ripper (password cracking)\n- CyberChef (decoding attempts)\n\n## **Environment:**\n\n- Local Kali Linux VM and THM target machine.\n\n# 🔍 Initial Recon\n\nBefore starting the challenge, I was given the machine's IP address, the service port (1337), and a username (smokey). I scanned the IP address with `nmap` to check for any other services — only SSH was found, which wasn’t needed for this challenge. After that, I connected directly to the service using `netcat`, and found a login prompt.\n\n# 🛠️ Exploitation / Solution\n\n## 1. First Login\n\n- I connected to the machine on try hack me via netcat.\n- I was presented with a login portal on my command line to the database.\n- I then entered the given username `smokey`, which produced a value on the screen.\n- At first I suspected some sort of encoding, so I tried decoding it with CyberChef but no luck.\n\n## 2. Finding out the Encoded Value\n\n- I saved the given \"password\" into a text file named `password.txt` to come back to if i had any light bulbs go off.\n- Decided to use John the Ripper on the file but, it hinted that the content could be UTF-8 encoding.\n- I then attempted further decoding with CyberChef, but still didn't retrieve anything useful so, i stopped that there.\n\n## 3. Trying SQL Injection\n\n- Attempted SQL queries manually through netcat:\n    - Basic inputs like `select from *` caused errors (bad syntax).\n    - Tried using `' OR 1=1` and variations, leading to different errors.\n    - Experimented with `' OR 1=1 --` which gave new error messages.\n    - After researching SQL payloads, I found a working query:\n\n```sql\n' UNION SELECT null, table_name FROM information_schema.tables --\n```\n\n- Initially struggled because the server restricted certain characters, but after testing different versions, I retrieved the admin's username and part of the flag.\n\n## 4. Finding the Username's Password\n\n- I explored the database schema further and its columns to see if there was any other data.\n- I found an `id` column and retrieved its data.\n- I made a query to filter the password table based on the `id`, which finally revealed the complete password for `smokey` and allowed me to get the final flag.\n\n# 🏴 Flag\n\n> THM{SQLit3_InJ3cTion_is_SimplE_nO?}\n> \n\n# 🧪 Tools Used\n\n- **nmap** — Scanned IP address to discover open ports/services.\n- **netcat** — Connected to the service manually.\n- **john the ripper** — Analyzed the provided encoded password.\n- **CyberChef** — Attempted various decoding methods.\n- **SQL Injection payload lists** — Helped craft injections.\n\n# 📝 Notes / Lessons Learned\n\n- SQL Injection requires creativity, especially when the environment restricts certain characters.\n- It's good practice to save any outputs like hashes or encoded data immediately into a file.\n- Testing payloads manually teaches a lot more than just copy-pasting.\n- Always explore the database structure (information schema) carefully if you have injection access.\n\n# 📷 Screenshots (Optional)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Light/Light_Screenshot_1.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Light/Light_Screenshot_2.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Light/Light_Screenshot_3.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Light/Light_Screenshot_4.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Light/Light_Screenshot_5.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Light/Light_Screenshot_6.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Light/Light_Screenshot_7.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Light/Light_Screenshot_8.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/Light/Light_Screenshot_9.png)\n",

Additionally, the file is also available on the AttackBox, under the `/Rooms/OhSINT` directory.\n\n# 🗃️ Files Provided\n\n- An image of the Windows XP wallpaper\n\n# 🌐 Challenge Setup\n\n## **Tools Used:**\n\n- **ExifTool** — for extracting metadata from images\n- **Google** — for OSINT investigations and lookups\n- **Wigle.net** — for BSSID/SSID lookup and geolocation\n\n## **Environment:**\n\n- TryHackMe AttackBox\n\n# 🔍 Initial Recon\n\nI first downloaded the image to take a closer look at it. on its own it looks like a random image of the windows wallpaper for windows XP. although as i have learned from watching films and stuff theres probably something more to it so thats what i did. \n\n# 🛠️ Exploitation / Solution\n\n## 1. Looking At the photo\n\n- I used **ExifTool** to extract metadata from the image. This revealed useful information such as GPS data and copyright information.\n- A key piece of data found was a copyright tag: **\"OWoodflint\"**.\n- I Googled this name, which led me to a **GitHub repository** containing a project called *People Finder*. The repository also contained a **WordPress website link** and an **email address**, answering two questions in the TryHackMe challenge.\n\n## 2. Exploring Further\n\n- Visiting the WordPress site revealed that the individual was located in **New York**, which answered another question on TryHackMe.\n- While browsing the site, I also noted a few potential clues hidden in the HTML source code (more on that later).\n\n## 3. Looking on x\n\n- A Google search for \"OWoodflint\" revealed an **X (Twitter)** account.\n- The profile image (avatar) was a **cat**, which answered the corresponding challenge question.\n- One of the tweets from the account mentioned a **BSSID**.\n- I used **wigle.net** to search for the BSSID and successfully obtained the corresponding **SSID** and **location name**.\n\n## 4. Finding the password\n\n- I returned to the WordPress site and viewed the **page source**.\n- Hidden in the HTML was a paragraph element that didn’t appear in the rendered page.\n- Copying and pasting that hidden text into TryHackMe revealed it to be the **final flag**, successfully completing the challenge.\n\n# 🏴 Flag\n\n```\nNone\n```\n\n# 🧪 Tools Used\n\n- **ExifTool** — For extracting metadata from the image\n- **CyberChef** — (if used for decoding any hidden strings)\n- **Wigle.net** — To identify SSID/location from BSSID\n- **Google/X** — For OSINT sleuthing and locating online accounts\n\n# 📝 Notes / Lessons Learned\n\n- Always check image metadata — you never know what's hidden in plain sight.\n- GitHub and social media can leak a lot more personal info than you'd expect.\n- Even seemingly harmless sites can contain hidden content in the source code.\n- OSINT is powerful — and sometimes terrifying.\n\n# 📷 Screenshots (Optional)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/OhSINT/OhSINT_1.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/OhSINT/OhSINT_2.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/OhSINT/OhSINT_3.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/OhSINT/OhSINT_4.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/OhSINT/OhSINT_5.png)\n",

The machine tests your understanding of file upload vulnerabilities, reverse shells, and Linux privilege escalation techniques.\n\n# 🗃️ Files Provided\n\n- No downloadable files were provided. The challenge was conducted entirely on a deployed TryHackMe machine.\n\n# 🌐 Challenge Setup\n\n## **Tools Used:**\n\n- **Nmap** — for port scanning and service detection\n- **Gobuster** — for directory brute-forcing\n- **Netcat** — for catching the reverse shell\n- **Searchsploit / GTFObins** — for privilege escalation research\n\n## **Environment:**\n\n- Kali Linux (VM)\n- Deployed machine IP\n\n# 🔍 Initial Recon\n\nI first loaded my kali linux vm and found the room on try hack me, I deployed the machine on try hack me to get ip address. I then used the ip address with nmap to scan for services. I found three things from this scan. firstly, i found that there was ssh on port 22; secondly, i found http on port 80 (signalling a web page is accessible); finally, I found the machine uses apache 2.4.29. These allowed me to start answering the questions on the challenge. Moving on, I used gobuster to search for any webpages to access. I then found a page called “panel” and “uploads”\n\n# 🛠️ Exploitation / Solution\n\n## Step 1:\n\n- The page called panel features a file upload function on it.\n- The question says to upload a file to get a reverse shell, the hint gave me more information mentioning about file upload bypasses and php reverse shells.\n- I then looked in kali linux for a default php reverse shell and found one.\n- I copied this to my documents and then uploaded it to the page.\n- I then go an error for the .php file, I then researched about other php file types.\n- Using a list i found i kept trying different php file types and checking the uploads page to see if i got one file type that works alongside netcat.\n- I found one and got access to the system.\n\n## Step 2:\n\n- After i had got the shell i then gathered basic info like “whoami”, which returned “www-data”.\n- The next question i had me go after a file called user.txt, i used the find command to look for it and found it at “/var/www/user.txt”\n- I then used the cat command on it and got a flag.\n\n## Step 3:\n\n- Based on the question for privailage escalation i went and used the search command to find SUID files that can be exploited for this to happen.\n- To do this i used my notes on linux privailge escalation to assist with this to help me do this.\n- I found there was a python file to use. so, using gtfoblins i inputed a python command to allow me to escalate to root user.\n- I used whoami to check if i did become a root user and i did. Following on, I then accessed the root folder and got the final flag.\n\n# 🏴 Flag\n\n```\nFlag 1: THM{y0u_g0t_a_sh3ll}\nFlag 2: THM{pr1v1l3g3_3sc4l4t10n}\n```\n\n# 🧪 Tools Used\n\n- **Nmap** — Port/service discovery\n- **Gobuster** — Directory enumeration\n- **Netcat** — Listener for reverse shell\n- **GTFObins** — Privilege escalation via known binary exploits\n\n# 📝 Notes / Lessons Learned\n\n- How to bypass file upload restrictions using alternate PHP extensions.\n- Practical use of reverse shells and basic post-exploitation.\n- SUID-based privilege escalation using Python and GTFOBins.\n- Importance of recon and methodical enumeration.\n\n# 📷 Screenshots (Optional)\n\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/RootMe/RootMe_Screenshot_1.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/RootMe/RootMe_Screenshot_2.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/RootMe/RootMe_Screenshot_3.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/RootMe/RootMe_Screenshot_4.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/RootMe/RootMe_Screenshot_5.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/RootMe/RootMe_Screenshot_6.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/RootMe/RootMe_Screenshot_7.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/RootMe/RootMe_Screenshot_8.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/RootMe/RootMe_Screenshot_9.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/RootMe/RootMe_Screenshot_10.png)\n![Screenshot of the challenge soloution](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/TryHackMe/RootMe/RootMe_Screenshot_11.png)\n",
